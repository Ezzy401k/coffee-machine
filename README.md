Day 15 of 100-day Python coding challenge
# Coffee Machine

This Python program simulates a simple coffee machine that allows users to order various coffee drinks.

## How it Works
The program displays a menu of available drinks, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Users can also request a report to see the current status of the coffee machine's resources (water, milk, coffee, and money). The program prompts users to input their choice of drink and handles the order process, including checking the availability of resources, accepting payment, and dispensing the drink. Users can also turn off the machine for maintenance.

## Features
- Interactive text-based interface.
- Menu-driven ordering system.
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee) and money tracking.
- Change calculation and dispensing.

## Requirements
- Python 3
